This repository demonstrates a common Perl bug: accessing an array element beyond its defined index.  The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The bug can lead to unexpected results or program crashes depending on the Perl interpreter and operating system.  Always validate array indices before accessing elements to prevent this issue.
